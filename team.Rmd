<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em; padding-right=100px">*Ekipa Fanihy* means 'Team Fruit Bat' in Malagasy. We are a collection of hard-working students and research staff investigating infection dynamics in three species of Madagascar fruit bat (*Pteropus rufus*, *Eidolon dupreanum*, and *Rousettus madagascariensis*). In an effort to build the longitudinal dataset needed to answer our research questions, we collect monthly biological samples from wild populations of the three Malagasy fruit bat species at several remote Madagascar field sites, then conduct molecular and serological assays on these samples to determine infection and immune status in the laboratory.

Anecia joined our team in January 2019 and has been with us through two field seasons. She works closely with Sami Kreling and Katie Fitzgerald to organize and lead monthly field collections on our project. In addition to field work, Anecia is currently reviewing previous modeling studies of bat infection dynamics and plans to apply to PhD programs in disease ecology in fall 2019. Anecia graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Ecology from Rice University in 2018.

Sarah is advised by [Professor Mike Boots](https://bootslab.org/) and studies the evolutionary underpinnings of cross-species zoonotic emergence. Sarah is carrying out a subset of dissertation chapters in part with Ekipa Fanihy, specifically investigating seasonal variation in inter-species contact rates, as well seasonal viral pulsing of potentially zoonotic viruses shed in bat excretia. Sarah holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Conservation Biology from Middlebury College and has previously studied foraging and learning behavior in bees, as well as served as the Program Coordinator for Harvard University's [Planetary Health Alliance](https://planetaryhealthalliance.org/).

Christian's PhD research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascan flying fox, *Pteropus rufus,* and *Bartonella* spp. infections of the Madagascan fruit bat, *Eidolon dupreanum.* As a postdoc, Christian will lead Next Generation Sequencing studies with targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. Christian holds a Master's degree in Biology, Ecology, and Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parsites of Malagasy reptiles.
