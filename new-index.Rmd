In the **Brook Lab** in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the **University of Chicago**, we work at the interface of disease ecology and conservation biology to study the dynamics of zoonotic infections, pathogens transmitted from wildlife to human hosts. 
<br>
<br>
Much of our work is focused on zoonotic infections derived from bat reservoirs, and we conduct the majority of our field studies in Madagascar.
