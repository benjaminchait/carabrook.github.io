\maketitle

I am a \href{https://brancoweissfellowship.org/}{Branco Weiss `Society
in Science' Fellow} (formerly a
\href{http://miller.berkeley.edu/}{Miller Fellow}), based jointly at the
University of California, Berkeley and the Institut Pasteur of
Madagascar. \textbf{I'll be starting as an Assistant Professor in the
\href{https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/}{Department of Ecology
and Evolution} at the University of Chicago in summer 2021}. Please feel
free to get in touch if you are interested in becoming a part of our
dynamic team!

I hail originally from beautiful Sonoma County, California, and I grew
up hiking backpacking, and camping across the North American West. In
2010, I completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Earth Systems, an
interdisciplinary environmental science major, at Stanford University,
and shortly after graduation, I travelled to Madagascar for the first
time as a sustainable development worker with World Wildlife Fund.

They say that those who drink the water of Manangareza River always find
their way back to Madagascar, and this is certainly true of me. After a
few years of transient globe-trotting, I made my way back to Madagascar
in 2012 to pursue a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton
University. Since 2012, I've been studying the dynamics of zoonotic
infections in this island nation, with a particular focus on emerging
pathogens derived from fruit bat reservoir hosts. Madagascar has shaped
my life in more ways than I can count: teaching me courage, humility,
wonder, and kindness, in addition to feeding my intellectual and
academic curiosity. I founded Ekipa Fanihy (Malagasy for `Team Fruit
Bat') out of a desire to undertake scientific development and capacity
building, joint with cutting-edge, international research. I believe
truly that the latter cannot be achieved without the former.
